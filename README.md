# Spam-Detection-using-Naive-Bayes-in-Python
This project demonstrates the implementation of a spam detection model using the Naive Bayes algorithm. The dataset consists of labeled messages, categorized as either "ham" (not spam) or "spam." The model is trained to classify text messages based on the presence of specific words and phrases that are commonly associated with spam.

# Features:
- Data loading and preprocessing using pandas.
- Text vectorization using the CountVectorizer.
- Implementation of the Naive Bayes algorithm for classification.
- Model evaluation with accuracy score.
- Predictions on new text samples to identify spam messages.
-Pipeline creation for streamlined text processing and model training.

# Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn
